# Warships
Warships is a simple game (based on SFML libary), in which you are supposed to destroy your enemy's ships. You are able to play versus AI or with another person in hot-seat mode.

While writing this project i was learning both C++ and SFML libary for the first time.

*Note: This is a technical page. If you are more interested in the game than technical details please visit: [SFML forum thread](https://en.sfml-dev.org/forums/index.php?topic=22569.0)*
